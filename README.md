# Temperature Monitoring System

## Overview
This project is a simple Temperature Monitoring System using a microcontroller, a temperature sensor, an LCD display, and an LED indicator. The system reads temperature data, displays it on the LCD, and controls an LED based on a predefined temperature threshold.

## Components
- Microcontroller: ESP32
- Temperature Sensor: LM35 DHT22
- LCD Display: 16x2 character display
- LED
- Resistors
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Features
- Measures temperature every second.
- Displays temperature readings on the LCD.
- Sends temperature data to a computer via serial communication (UART).

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram that shows how to connect the components:
1. Connect the temperature sensor to the microcontroller.
2. Wire the LCD to the microcontroller.
3. Connect the LED with a resistor in series.
4. Set up the serial communication for data transfer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE (or any compatible development environment)
- Microcontroller and components listed above
